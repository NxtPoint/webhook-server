# db_views.py â€” Silver = passthrough + derived (from bronze), Gold = thin extract
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This version restores stable point/game numbering and deuce/ad:
# - Use fact_swing.serve as primary serve signal (fallback only if absent)
# - Points = cumulative serves; Games increment when server UID changes
# - Serving side = deuce for point_in_game odd; ad for even
# - Bounce -> swing: first FLOOR bounce after swing, capped at next serve timestamp
# - Player-at-hit from fact_player_position (nearest sample)
# - Rally location = A/B/C/D (width quartiles), depth = short/mid/long
# - Terminal error classification (net / wide / long) + winner id
