# db_views.py â€” Silver passthrough + serve-aware point ordering & enriched point rows
# Rules implemented:
# - Point #1 always belongs to Game #1 (point numbers normalized to start at 1)
# - Serve := any swing where swing_type ILIKE '%overhead%'  (fh_overhead and variants)
# - Error := ball_speed <= 0  (NULL treated as 0)
# - Second serve: consecutive overheads inside a point; if two serve-faults => double fault (receiver wins, next point)
# - Game changes when SERVER CHANGES between points (by server_uid when present, else server_id)
# - Serving side: odd point_in_game = 'deuce', even = 'ad'
