# - SportAI sends coordinates in METERS. We do not autoscale; we treat x/y as meters.
# - Serve bucket logic / winner / score NOT added here (we'll layer later).
# - For transparency, we expose the FIRST FLOOR bounce per swing window and publish
#   bounce_x_center_m / bounce_y_center_m / bounce_y_norm_m (meters + normalized Y).
