# db_views.py â€” Silver = passthrough + derived (from bronze), Gold = thin extract
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RULES
# - serve_d per swing: (swing_type in {'fh_overhead','fh-overhead'}) AND (within 0.5 m inside baseline to back fence)
# - serving side mapping:
#     top (y < mid_y)    -> deuce if x > mid_x else ad
#     bottom (y >= mid_y)-> deuce if x < mid_x else ad
# - points: first serve = point 1; point increments only when serving side flips between consecutive serves
# - games: start at 1; increment when server UID changes
# - Final Silver outputs exactly the agreed columns (minus server_behind_baseline_at_first_d which you removed)
