# Billing — implementation reference

> **Part of the Ten-Fifty5 business documentation set** ([master index](README.md)).
>
> Module-level reference for the billing subsystem. Files are scattered at repo root (not in a subdirectory), so this doc plays the role of a `billing/README.md`.

For the **business rules** (what's a credit, what gates upload, how the soft-delete contract works), read [`README.md`](README.md). For **pricing tiers and plan IDs**, read [`pricing-and-packages.md`](pricing-and-packages.md). This doc is the **file map + entry points + flow**.

## What this owns

- The `billing.*` Postgres schema (`account`, `member`, `entitlement_grant`, `entitlement_consumption`, `subscription_state`, `subscription_event_log`, `coaches_permission`, `monthly_refill_log`, `entitlements`, `vw_customer_usage`)
- The credit grant / consumption / entitlements logic
- The subscription webhook handling (PayPal — LIVE; Wix — rollback fallback) via the shared `apply_subscription_event` path + monthly refill cron driver
- Two ops endpoints (`/api/billing/summary`, `/api/billing/entitlement/check`, `/api/billing/entitlement/grant`) for backoffice use
- The `entitlements_api` UPSERT that derives all permission flags into `billing.entitlements`
- The capacity-sweep cron that detects stuck ingests / trims (auxiliary, not strictly billing)

## What this is NOT

- **Not the upload gate caller.** `upload_app.py` reads from `billing.entitlements` to decide if a request is allowed. This module *writes* the table; the consumer is `upload_app`.
- **Not the payment processor.** Since 2026-06-16 payment is **direct PayPal** (`paypal_billing/`, LIVE) — it owns checkout, the plan catalogue, and the signature-verified webhook. This module receives the *normalized* lifecycle event (from PayPal now; Wix only as the `PAYPAL_ENABLED=0` fallback) and translates it to credit grants via the shared `subscriptions_api.apply_subscription_event(payload, provider)`.
- **Not the AI Coach paywall.** That gate lives in `tennis_coach/coach_api.py::_check_ai_coach_entitled`. It reads `billing.subscription_state` and `billing.member.role` directly — bypasses `billing.entitlements` because it pre-dates that table.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `models_billing.py` | SQLAlchemy ORM declarations (`Account`, `Member`, `EntitlementGrant`, `EntitlementConsumption`) + **`billing_init()`** — the idempotent base-schema bootstrap (run on boot from `upload_app.py`). It creates the 4 ORM tables (`create_all`) plus the previously code-less raw objects (`subscription_state`, `subscription_event_log`, `monthly_refill_log`, `coaches_permission`, `entitlements`, `security_access`, `vw_customer_usage`) so a fresh DB reproduces prod. Column *additions* still live in their `_ensure_*` owners (`client_api._ensure_member_profile_columns`, `billing_service._ensure_technique_columns`, `subscriptions_api._ensure_subscription_state_columns`, `entitlements_api._ensure_entitlements_schema`). |
| `billing_service.py` | The behavioural core. Account/member create-with-guard-rails, entitlement grant with three-way idempotency, consumption (match + technique), monthly no-rollover reset, coach cap gate, signup bonus. Direct callers from everywhere. |
| `billing_import_from_bronze.py` | Reconciliation: scans `bronze.submission_context` for completed tasks without consumption rows and writes them. Auto-creates accounts on the fly if needed. Used as a CLI tool for backfill, and called from ingest worker step 5. |
| `entitlements_api.py` | The big derived-flags UPSERT. One SQL statement that reads `account`, `member`, `subscription_state`, `entitlement_grant`, `entitlement_consumption`, `coaches_permission` and writes `billing.entitlements`. Single source of truth for `can_upload`, `can_view_dashboards`, `can_link_additional_player`, block reasons. |
| `subscriptions_api.py` | The **shared normalize→grant path** `apply_subscription_event(payload, provider)` + the Wix webhook endpoint (`/api/billing/subscription/event`, now the fallback) + monthly refill endpoint. Idempotent per event by sha256 of canonical fields. The PayPal receiver (`paypal_billing/webhook.py`) calls `apply_subscription_event(provider='paypal')` in-process — one grant path, two front doors. |
| `paypal_billing/` | **Direct PayPal payments (LIVE 2026-06-16) — replaces Wix Pricing Plans checkout.** `webhook.py` (signature-verified receiver → refetch from PayPal → `apply_subscription_event`; server-side create-subscription / create-order / capture-order / cancel-subscription; public `/config` probe), `client.py` (REST client), `plans.py` + committed `catalog.json` (plan catalogue + live Product/Billing-Plan ids), dark `register(app)` on `PAYPAL_ENABLED`. `billing.*` only (core mirror deferred). Full reference: `paypal_billing/README.md`. |
| `usage_api.py` | OPS_KEY ops endpoints: `summary`, `entitlement/check`, `entitlement/grant`. For backoffice / integration scripts / one-off corrections. |
| `cron_monthly_refill.py` | **Render cron.** Single HTTP POST to `/api/billing/cron/monthly_refill`. The endpoint owns the logic; this script is just the trigger. |
| `cron_capacity_sweep.py` | **Render cron.** Detects stuck ingests / trims by reading `bronze.submission_context` directly. Not strictly billing, but co-located with the other cron driver. |

  ├─ source ∈ {wix_subscription, wix_payg, paypal_subscription, paypal_payg, manual_adjustment, signup_bonus}
  ├─ plan_code, external_wix_id (NULLABLE) — **reused by PayPal** (`purchase:{order_id}:{account_id}`); a misnomer pending the Wix-payment-deprecation rename to `external_id`
  ├─ matches_granted, techniques_granted
  ├─ valid_from, valid_to (NULLABLE = lifetime), is_active
  └─ idempotency: see grant_entitlement three-way rule above

billing.entitlement_consumption          (deduction ledger — append-only)
  ├─ account_id (FK)
  ├─ task_id (UNIQUE) — UUID-coerced via uuid5(NAMESPACE_URL, str)
  ├─ consumed_matches (default 1), consumed_techniques (default 0)

  ├─ account_id, plan_id (PayPal Billing-Plan id, or legacy Wix UUID), plan_code, status, period_end
  ├─ billing_provider ∈ {wix, paypal} — the monthly cron refills only 'wix'; PayPal subs are webhook-driven (grant per renewal payment)
  ├─ provider_subscription_id — PayPal subscription id (I-…) used to cancel; NULL for Wix
  └─ entitlements UPSERT picks the most recent by updated_at when multiple exist

billing.subscription_event_log           (Wix + PayPal webhook audit + idempotency)

billing.vw_customer_usage                (legacy view — pre-entitlements table)
  └─ matches_granted, matches_consumed, matches_remaining, last_processed_at
```

## Flow — a subscription/payment event becomes credits

> Both providers feed the SAME `subscriptions_api.apply_subscription_event(payload, provider)`.
> **PayPal (LIVE):** `paypal_billing/webhook.py` verifies PayPal's signature, **refetches** the
> resource from PayPal, then calls it with `provider='paypal'` — recurring grants on
> `PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED` (`valid_to`=next billing → no rollover), PAYG on capture (never expires).
> **Wix (fallback):** the OPS_KEY `/api/billing/subscription/event` endpoint calls it with
> `provider='wix'`. The diagram below is the normalized shape both share.

## Gotchas

- **`grant_entitlement` has three idempotency strategies.** See [`README.md`](README.md) §3 for the table. Mixing them up will create duplicate grants or block legitimate ones.
- **Consumption is never deleted.** Soft-delete contract in [`README.md`](README.md) §7. The sweep at `cleanup/orphan_sweep.py` explicitly skips `billing.*`.
- **`task_id` is UUID-coerced.** Non-UUID strings become deterministic UUIDs via `uuid5(NAMESPACE_URL, str)`. Same string always produces the same UUID — that's the idempotency hook.
- **Subscription "ACTIVE" wins by recency.** When multiple `subscription_state` rows exist, `entitlements_api` UPSERT picks the most recent by `updated_at`. Stale CANCELLED rows can't block a renewed account.
- **`can_upload` does NOT require `paid_active`.** Free-trial credits are real credits — uploading on the signup bonus works. The gate is purely `account_active AND role <> 'coach' AND matches_remaining > 0`.
- **`can_view_dashboards` retains forever once any credit is consumed.** This is the conversion hook. Don't "fix" this — it's load-bearing. See `entitlements_api.py:196-203` and [`README.md`](README.md) §4.
- **Coach cap fires at accept time, not invite time.** Existing accepted coach links are grandfathered. The gate is in `coach_invite/accept_page.py`, not in the invite-creation flow.
- **Free Coach Access Wix plan does NOT count as paid.** Hard-coded plan ID `cd2b6772-1880-42ec-9049-4d9e4decc42b` is excluded from `is_coach_pro`. Free coach subscribers still hit the 1-player cap.
- **`OPS_KEY` env var: `BILLING_OPS_KEY` checked first, then `OPS_KEY`.** Both files (`subscriptions_api`, `usage_api`) follow this order. Set `BILLING_OPS_KEY` if you want a separate billing key; otherwise `OPS_KEY` works.
- **`billing_service._ensure_technique_columns()` runs on import** (`billing_service.py:75`). It widens the `source` CHECK constraint and adds `techniques_*` columns. This is part of why `billing_service` is import-time-side-effect-heavy.
- **Account auto-creation in reconciliation.** `billing_import_from_bronze` will create a fresh `billing.account` for any completed bronze task that lacks one (`_find_or_create_account`). This means uploads via legacy paths or manual bronze inserts still land in billing.

## Required environment variables

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection |
| `OPS_KEY` | Auth for all `/api/billing/*` ops endpoints (with optional `BILLING_OPS_KEY` override) |
| `CLIENT_API_KEY` | Not used here — but consumed by the entitlements *readers* in `client_api.py` |
